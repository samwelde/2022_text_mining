# 2022_text_mining
Algorithm-based analysis methods for discovering meaning structures from unstructured or weakly structured text data.

- 90% of data today has been created in the last two years.
- 235 million emails sent per day
- 3.8 million Google searches performed each minute
- 1.7 megabytes of new information created every second, per person

= An immense amount of data, new and old, is recorded as text.
âž¥ More generally, much of this data is unstructured

Unstructured Data
- Does not adhere to a defined data model.
- is typically text-heavy
- e.g. text feeds, speech transcripts, audio, images, mainly text-like data
- Text is inherently unstructured and high-dimensional.
- one of the major fields of application of machine learning methods.
- fast-growing field. Many new techniques developed in industry.


Goal was to:
1. Process and transform un-/semi-structured data.
2. Represent inherently unstructured text data.
3. Analyse text data and use models to discover structure (un-/supervised learning).
